### 09 Servers and APIs

## Description
For this challenge I updated a weather dashboard application that pulls information from a 5 day weather forecast API. The website prompts the user to search for a city using the search bar. Once the user searches the site will grab data from the API and display a 5-day forecast that includes an icon, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed for each day. This site also has the ability to store the search history of the user. This history component allows the user to click on the stored city and have the 5-day forecast displayed. The weather dashboard site is tageted for anyone who is curious about the what the weather will be like for the next week.
