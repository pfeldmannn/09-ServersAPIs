# 09 Servers and APIs

## Description
I updated a weather dashboard application that fetches data from a 5-day weather forecast API. Users can search for a city using the search bar, and the site will retrieve and display a detailed 5-day forecast, including an icon, temperature, humidity, and wind speed for each day. Additionally, the application stores the user's search history, allowing them to revisit previous searches by clicking on the saved city.
